VNDS .scr file format:

for any clarification on the usage of these, look at a .scr from another VN

bgload:
    usage: bgload file [delay]
    looks in background/ for the image and draws it as the background
    control length of the delay in frames with background will be displayed before proceeding to the script (default 0)
    
setimg:
    usage: setimg file x y
    looks in foreground/ for the image and draws it at the point (x,y)
    the x y values must be the MegaDrive values not the scaled ones.

sound:
    usage: sound file times
    looks in sound/ for the file, loads it into memory(don`t do this with 
        anything over a meg in size) and plays it X times. -1 for infinite
        looping.
    if file is ~, it stops any currently playing sound.
    
music:
    usage: music file
    looks in sound/ for the file, 
    
    music is expected to be in mp3 format
    if file is ~, it stops the music.

text:
    usage: text string
    displays text to the screen.
    
    if string is !, it`ll make a blank text with an ! at the bottom right and require clicking to advance
    
choice:
    usage: choice option1|option2|etc...
    displays choices on the screen
    
    when a choice is clicked, selected is set to the value of what was
        selected, starting at 1.
    use if selected == 1, etc to go off what was selected.

ifchoice:
    usage: choice var1 == 1:option1|option2|etc...
    displays choices on the screen but if the condition is true.
    in this case if the variable var1 is 1 then option1 will be displayed.
    Condition and choice text are separated by a :
    
    when a choice is clicked, selected is set to the value of what was
        selected, starting at 1.
    use if selected == 1, etc to go off what was selected.

setvar/gsetvar:
    usage: setvar modifier value
    sets a variable
    
    modifier: =, +. -
    setvar puts values into local save memory, to be kept in normal save files
        for things like character flags and such
    gsetvar sets variables in global.sav
        for things like cleared path flags
    prefix a variable with $ to use it in other commands: `text var is $var`
        {$var} can be used if needed to separate the variable from other text
        
if/fi:
    usage: 
        if x == 1
            commands
        fi
    conditional jump
    
    if true, it keeps reading. if false, it skips till it encounters a fi
    Note: left operand must be a variable, right may be either
        This is due to either redoing every script to put $ in front of the
            variables, or just making left not default to string if the
            variable doesnt exist.
    
jump:
    usage: jump file.scr [label]
    looks in script/ for the .scr and starts reading off that.
    if label is specified, jumps to that label in the script

delay:
    usage: delay X
    X being number of frames to hold, DS runs at 60 frames per second.

random: // NOT IMPLEMENTED
    usage: random var low high
    set var to a number between low and high (inclusive)

label/goto:
    usage:
        label name
        goto name
    
    a goto command will search the current script for a label with the same 
        name and start the script from that part

cleartext:
    usage: cleartext [type]
    clears text from the screen.
 
    if no type is given, it`ll make enough blank lines to fill the display
    if type is !, it`ll completely clear the text buffer (including history)
